Inverse Graphics: Teaching Artificial Neural Networks Simple Game Physics project.Project includes methods that establish a neural network that predicts the next step by teaching the machine the laws of physics of a virtual environment. 
Creating a animation on unity area, Getting data from animation and creating a neural network with that data,finally making estimation.
Some python libraries and unity platform are used.
